Luke is daydreaming in Math class. He has a sheet of graph paper with n rows and m columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of  bases.
He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot.
If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it's considered to be supplied. For example:


import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

#
# Complete the 'gameWithCells' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER n
#  2. INTEGER m
#

def gameWithCells(n, m):
  
return (m//2+m%2)*(n//2+n%2)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    first_multiple_input = input().rstrip().split()

    n = int(first_multiple_input[0])

    m = int(first_multiple_input[1])

    result = gameWithCells(n, m)

    fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
