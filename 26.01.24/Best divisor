Kristen loves playing with and comparing numbers.
She thinks that if she takes two different positive numbers,
the one whose digits sum to a larger number is better than the other. 
If the sum of digits is equal for both numbers, then she thinks the smaller number is better. 
For example, Kristen thinks that  13 is better 31 than 12  and that 11 is better than .

Given an integer,n , can you find the divisor of n that Kristin will consider to be the best?




n = int(input().strip())
t = int(math.sqrt(n))+1
max = -1
min_num = 100001
for i in range(1,t):
    if(n%i == 0):
        num = n//i
        sum = 0
        for j in range(int(math.log10(num))+1):
            sum += num%10
            num = num//10
        if(max <sum):
            max = sum

        if(max == sum):
                min_num = n//i

print(min_num)
