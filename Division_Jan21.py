#Task 1
'''The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of  integer division,  a//b . The second line
 should contain the result of float division, a / b.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.'''

#Solution 1: 

a = 10
b = 3
print(a//b)
print(a/b)

#Solution 2:

c=a//b
d=a/b
print(c)
print(d)
